<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">There are many factors that must go into determining which programming language (or languages) to use in certain projects. Most seasoned developers already have a toolbelt of their own preferred languages and technologies for certain types of projects but they still go through a series of questions and considerations of the project at hand to make a final decision.
Every programming language comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, and it’s definitely critical for the success of the project and business to choose the right one. This decision is also dependent upon the business’s long-term goals and overall expectations.</td>

##<center> **Questions to Ask When Selecting a Programming Language**
&nbsp;
1. What is the intended environment on which to run the project: mobile, web, enterprise-level?
1. Does the client have a preference based on previous experience and projects?
1. Can the development team successfully program in the language? Would there be a big learning curve? Or would this require the hiring of new developers?
1. What kind of performance considerations exist for the project? Will the language help improve and meet performance expectations?
1. Does the language feature proper ecosystem support? Will it endure for a long time without needing updates?
1. Does the vendor provide support for the language? Are there any existing or legacy codebase considerations for the project?
1. Is there a digital community of developers available for resources and support?
1. Does the language easily integrate with third-party tools?
1. What are the considerations for the security of the language?
